# transformers_intro

This repo is a work in progress.

This will be a systematic introduction to Transformers with well chosen examples starting with basic concepts such as Back-propagation, we will dive into Sequential Models, look into RNNs, LSTM models and Gated RNNs. We will look into Latent Semantic Analsysis, etc.
